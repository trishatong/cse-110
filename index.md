# About Me!
## Intro
Hi! My name is Trisha and I'm a second-year Computer Science major at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/). I chose to major in CS because I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of it as well as the immediate satsifaction you get when your code compiles and works. In my free time I enjoy going to the beach, being active, and hanging out with friends and family!
