## Topic
Old Business (review)
- Decided on tarot cards as project focus
- Current idea: Site provides interpretation of cards (past, present, future) 
- General implementation: open site, press start, select 3 cards, click individual card and have it flip over; website generates sentence based on 3 cards to describe relations and possibly future events
- Text descriptions will be generated by ChatGPT
- Site shouldn't rely on any API
- Satvik (TA) mentioned adding a second fortune teller if needed (paper fortune teller)

Cards
- 20 cards (20<sup>3</sup> generations)

- Potentially add 3-5 "fun" cards after most infrastructure is complete

Trello
- Main way of tracking tasks/progress

Team Divisions
- 2 teams of 5, 1 leader each
- Team A(nimation)
  - Card transformation animation (moving from x1, y1 to x2, y2 or animating the card bigger or smaller)
  - Surrounding card animation (ex: smoke)
  - Find/generate sound effects for the project
- Team T(ext)
  - Spreadsheets and chatGPT to generate card responses
  - How text is stored and accessed
  - How text is displayed and animated
- After finishing individual APIs, team will combine code and work on bigger features as a team
- Teams will be decided based on first-come first-served process

Future Meetings
- Confirmed weekly meetings Tuesdays @9:30pm
- Dedicated meetings (pair/group programming) week to week if needed
- Potential "OH" with team leaders

Goals for Next Meeting
- Solidify teams 
- Each team decide how to begin implementation
- Determine coding style
- Have basic understanding of tarot cards
